name: Allocation Equity Priority (Strict Proportional)
description: |
  Strict proportional allocation (allocation equity priority).
  Adequacy floors are relaxed, so some households may have poor
  nutrition outcomes despite receiving their "fair share."
  Demonstrates that proportional allocation â‰  adequate nutrition.

  Use case: When proportional treatment is paramount, even at the cost of
  relaxing nutritional adequacy floors.
model:

    Base model with allocation equity and nutritional adequacy constraints.
    Dials are tuned to prioritise proportional allocation equity.
