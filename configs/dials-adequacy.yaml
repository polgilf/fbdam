  Policy emphasis: NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY

  Prioritises minimum nutritional outcomes for all households and nutrients.
  Allocation may deviate substantially from fair-share proportions to ensure
  everyone meets basic nutrition thresholds.

  Use case: When preventing malnutrition is paramount, even if some households
  receive more or less than their proportional share.
