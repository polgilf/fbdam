name: Efficiency (Utility Maximisation)
description: |
  Policy emphasis: EFFICIENCY

  Relaxes both allocation equity caps and nutritional adequacy floors so the
  optimiser can maximise total nutritional utility. Suitable for understanding
  the unconstrained efficiency frontier.
model:

    Base model with allocation equity and nutritional adequacy constraints.
    Dials are relaxed to emphasise total utility.
