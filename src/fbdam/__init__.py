"""
fbdam â€” Food Basket Design and Allocation Model
------------------------------------------------
Top-level package for the FBDAM optimization system.

This module exposes a concise, friendly API for common tasks:

    from fbdam import build_model, solve_model, write_report
    # or run the CLI (if installed with entry point):
    #   fbdam --help

Design notes:
- Keep imports lightweight to avoid side effects.
- Export only stable, high-level entry points.
