"""
fbdam â€” Food Basket Design and Allocation Model
------------------------------------------------
Top-level package for the FBDAM optimization system.

This module exposes a concise, friendly API for common tasks:

    from fbdam import build_model, solve_model, write_report
    # or run the CLI (if installed with entry point):
    #   fbdam --help

Design notes:
- Keep imports lightweight to avoid side effects.
- Export only stable, high-level entry points.

# Package version (sync with pyproject.toml)

# High-level, stable API imports (do NOT re-export submodules wholesale)

# Optional: expose the Typer CLI app (if you want programmatic access).
#
# Importing ``fbdam`` as part of ``python -m fbdam.engine.run`` previously
# imported the CLI module eagerly, which triggered a ``runpy`` warning because
# the module was already present in ``sys.modules`` before the interpreter tried
# to execute it as ``__main__``.  We now defer the import until the attribute is
# actually requested.
