"""
fbdam.engine â€” Core execution engine
------------------------------------
Contains the core building blocks used to load configuration/data,
assemble the Pyomo model, solve it, and emit reports.

Public API (developer-facing):
    - load_scenario: read/validate config + datasets (if implemented)
    - DomainIndex:  typed, immutable domain container
    - build_model:  construct Pyomo model from DomainIndex + spec
    - solve_model:  run the solver (appsi_highs / highs)
    - write_report: generate structured artifacts (manifest, metrics, tables)

Internal modules (not re-exported here):
    - constraints, objectives: plugin registries
